# Teaching and Life

This is a collection of documents about my teaching at Montgomery College. For the first time in my life I want to concentrate on developing my teaching skills.    

I have always assumed  I was a good teacher. And it is true I have some traits that make me good at establishing rapport with others, even intimacy. But there are technical aspects of being a good teacher, the sufficiency to complement the necessity I already have. I'm not sure what form this project is going to take, but I want to take it. 

I know I am in the last phase of my life. I have decided I need to keep working and growing. I was surprised by this in a way. I have been lazy, sort of, most of my life.And as one time I looked forward to retirement as a time in which I could do whatever I wanted to do. It just turns out I wanted to teach. A career I left for a variety of good and bad reasons, mostly immaturity and dysphoria on my part. But here I am and thanks to the Pandemic, I've had time to grow and become a bit more of myself. 

Am I thankful for the Pandemic? No. But I am thankful for the opportunity to become more of myself than I ever had been. 

So this repository will be my vault of personal and professional thinking and development.

Let the games begin!
